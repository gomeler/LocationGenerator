Want to generate random towns filled with various structures and populated by NPCs.


Determine the number of buildings desired via a random selection along some sort of array, perhaps fibonacci sequence?

Roll for what types of structures are generated. Perhaps weight it with some sort of logical minimums required to create a reasonable town.

I think we'll leave population generation to one-offs as needed pending adventuring.

Architecture:

Figure out how big the town will initially be. I think this is where the fibonacci sequence will come along, with recommended sizes that match an optional size argument.

Once the size is determined, roll to determine the percentages of buildings that'll be of various types. Each type should likely have a hardcoded minimum and maximum limit, so we don't end up with towns featuring 100% prisons for example.

Generic building struct that each specific type struct will implement. Some buildings will have a child struct that they can be replaced with.

Building struct:
	category String
	name String
	maximumPercentage Integer
	childBuilding struct
	childChance Integer

Thoughts on weighted sorting:
return the index of the selected item!


Thoughts on location generation:
1) randomly generate the quantity regarding buildings to be generated
2) generate the buildings, adhering to the maximum quantity and maximum percentage values.
	2a) evolve buildings, keeping the above in mind. If an evolution is illegal, roll back to the child vs re-rolling the buildings.

I think for now it'll be safe to keep track of the buildings while evolving them via a simple name:quantity map. I don't need unique values for the various buildings, I think each building will be tailored/configured in another step. The first step is simply figuring out how large the town is.
